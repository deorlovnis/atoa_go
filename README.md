# atoa_go 🤖-🤖

atoa_go is an open source Go library designed to help developers build, connect, and manage third-party software agents. It focuses on security, reliability and authenticity of such interaction between independent parties and the agents that represent them.

## 🎯 Mission

To make it easy for developers to build secure and reliable connections between third-party agents using well-defined interaction protocols and a centralized coordination layer.

Modern systems are increasingly composed of autonomous software agents — representing services, organizations, or users — that need to discover each other, negotiate interactions, and collaborate without tight coupling.

I saw a need for high speed solutions in this area that a go language can help with.

## 🔧 Features

atoa_go helps developers solve this problem by providing:

- ✅ A consistent framework for agent registration and identity
- 🔐 Protocol support for secure session establishment
- 🔍 Tools for offer discovery, matching, and session orchestration
- 🧩 Extensible interfaces for evolving standards like MCP and A2A
